Oversite is a goal tracking app with a twist; if you don't meet your goals, we tell your Mom. There are few stronger motivators than mother's approval. Users can input the metrics used for their custom goal, and use the platform to update their progress as they go. When setting a completion date for their goal, they have the option to include an email address to send a custom message to, upon failure or success of their goal. For best results, use your moms email.
